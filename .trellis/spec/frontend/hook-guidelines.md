## Data Fetching

Overview traffic-history polling follows the operator's global auto-refresh
selection. Keep the initial request when the overview, device, or time range
changes, but only create the periodic timer when the selected interval is
greater than zero. A zero interval means "停止刷新" and must not leave a
separate chart-specific timer running.
